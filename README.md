# A glimpse of Lean

This repository is an introduction to theorem proving in Lean for the impatient.
The goal is to get a feel for what proving in Lean looks like in 2 or 3 hours,
or maybe devote half a day or a full day.

There are two tracks. Both start with reading the `Introduction.lean` file.

Then the short track continues in the `00Start.lean` file which is meant to give
you access to not completely empty mathematical proofs in two hours if you are
ready to move pretty fast.

If you have a bit more time, you should instead read explanations and do
exercises in the `Basics` folder, and then choose to work on one file from the
`Topics` folder. Of course, you can play with all files from that folder if you
have even more time.

To work using Lean, you either have to install Lean locally, or use a [lean4web
server](https://live.lean-lang.org/).

## Online version, no registration

If you donâ€™t want to install Lean, you can use the [lean4web server](https://live.lean-lang.org/) hosted by the [Lean FRO](https://lean-fro.org/) as follows:

* read [the introduction file](https://live.lean-lang.org/#project=GlimpseOfLean&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FPatrickMassot%2FGlimpseOfLean%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2FGlimpseOfLean%2FIntroduction.lean)
* then read and edit the explanations and exercises in the [00Start.lean file](https://live.lean-lang.org/#project=GlimpseOfLean&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FPatrickMassot%2FGlimpseOfLean%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2FGlimpseOfLean%2FExercises%2FShorter.lean)

for the shorter track.

If you want to do the longer track then the relevant links are:

for the basics. And then you can choose depending on your mathematical
interests:
* [SequenceLimits](https://live.lean-lang.org/#project=GlimpseOfLean&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FPatrickMassot%2FGlimpseOfLean%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2FGlimpseOfLean%2FExercises%2FTopics%2FSequenceLimits.lean) for elementary properties of sequences of real numbers.
* [RingTheory](https://live.lean-lang.org/#project=GlimpseOfLean&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FPatrickMassot%2FGlimpseOfLean%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2FGlimpseOfLean%2FExercises%2FTopics%2FRingTheory.lean) for some commutative algebra, up to the Chinese remainder theorem in commutatives rings.
* [Probability](https://live.lean-lang.org/#project=GlimpseOfLean&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FPatrickMassot%2FGlimpseOfLean%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2FGlimpseOfLean%2FExercises%2FTopics%2FProbability.lean) for some probability theory.

* [GaloisAdjunctions](https://live.lean-lang.org/#project=GlimpseOfLean&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FPatrickMassot%2FGlimpseOfLean%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2FGlimpseOfLean%2FExercises%2FTopics%2FGaloisAdjunctions.lean) for some elementary abstract non-sense (adjunctions between ordered sets with applications to group theory and topology).

You can refer to the [tactics cheatsheet](tactics.pdf) while doing the
exercises. Tactics are explained in the Lean file, but the pdf can be more
convenient as a reference.

## Local installation

If you want the full luxury Lean experience, you should install it on your
computer.
For this you can follow these instructions (copied from Maria Ines de Frutos-Fernandez).

1. Install Lean, following the instructions [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).

2. Open a terminal and download this repository using `git clone https://github.com/harryrichman/glimpse-of-lean.git`.

3. Run `cd glimpse-of-lean` to enter the newly-created folder.

4. Run `lake exe cache get!` to download build dependencies (uses ~5GB).

5. Open the folder `glimpse-of-lean` in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you have a lot more time, you should read the book [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/).
